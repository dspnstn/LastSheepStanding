# LastSheepStanding
Project files for my Unity-based 3D game.

Casual game about survival of the sheepest.

There are 2 things to do on the Island in the sky: eating tomatoes and avoiding the Big Bad Wolf. Click on the grass to point your sheep in needed direction, pick tomatoes and walk towards the Platform each time it appears, and stand on it, so the Wolf eats someone else. If you click past the grass, your sheep jumps off and dies. Also, beware walking the edges of the Island - some of your sheep-neighbours are quite mean-spirited and might push you off the ground. Become the ultimate survivor - the Last Sheep Standing.
